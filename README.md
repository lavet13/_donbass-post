# Ideas:
- [x] pick colors and define them in tailwind
- [x] react query query key generator(GET requests)
- [x] try and implement form with TanStack Form(newly released package). UPD: it's as good as react-hook-form, even better than I expected
- [] point/list endpoint is needed for displaying schedule info
- [] add sonner
