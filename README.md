# Ideas:

- [x] pick colors and define them in tailwind
- [x] react query query key generator(GET requests)
- [x] try and implement form with TanStack Form(newly released package). UPD: it's as good as react-hook-form, even better than I expected
- [x] point/list endpoint is needed for displaying schedule info
- [x] add loading state for combobox
- [x] useBlocker shouldn't block if the user submitted the form
- [x] make unified combobox, instead of making 2 separate ones
- [] never have been used the vitest, try it, at least for testing the forms
- [] fix the focus-visible for auth buttons
- [x] I might need to show departments outside of popover by utilizing the modal(vaul drawer)
- [x] add new stylings for autodismissMessage(info, warn, error)
- [] add sonner
- [] try to redirect user after deleting cookie from browser console(test)
- [] try wrapping autodismissmessage into something that drawer vaul has implemented(compound component)
- [x] add the calculator for "Забор груза", endpoint: 'https://workplace-post.ru/api/delivery-rate/calculate-global',
- [x] queryClient.ensureQueryData in loader to preload of course
- [] making nav-user
- [x] add sidebar-button variants
- [] rethink about the way we define our components per page -components folder inside /routes
- [] create schedules
- [] setup telegram-mini-app
- [] view transition in tanstack router
- [] finish styling the sidebar and add second version of sidebar(drawer/vaul) for mobile viewport
- [] Yandex Maps API (read docs, create simple map)
- [x] try implementing loading indicator(e.g. botfather's mini app), and basic fade in and out animation
